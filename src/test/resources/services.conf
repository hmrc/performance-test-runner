# This file is read when runLocal = false in application.conf (default is false)

# This can be used to override the 'baseUrl'

# If the service name you are searching is found, baseUrl is overridden.
# For local development convenience, host and protocol will have the following defaults:
#      protocol = http
#      port = 80

# Example 1: (the base url for helloworld-service is https://internal.helloworld-service.co.uk:9000)
# helloworld-service {
#      protocol = https
#      host = internal.helloworld-service.co.uk
#      port = 9000
# }

# Example 2: (the base url for helloworld-service is http://internal.helloworld-service.co.uk)
# helloworld-service.host = internal.helloworld-service.co.uk


services {

  helloworld-service.host = internal.helloworld-service.co.uk
