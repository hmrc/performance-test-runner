# Configure here your journeys. A journey is a sequence of requests at a certain load.

journeys {

  # Example
  # Give a name to the journey.
  hello-world-1 = {

    # The description will appear in the test report. Use something meaningful
    description = "Hello world journey 1"

    # The load is in journeys per second. Put here the load you are going to have at the peak.
    # There is no need to put a higher value at this point. Use prerftest.loadPercentage in application.conf instead
    load = 9.1

    # This points to a csv file with the data you need to inject in the journey. [More here](https://github.com/hmrc/performance-test-runner#step-4-configure-the-user-feeder)
    feeder = data/helloworld.csv

    # The parts your journey is made of. A part is made one or more requests.
    parts = [
      login,
      home
    ]
  }

  # Add more journeys like this:
  hello-world-2 = {
    description = "Hello world journey 2"
    load = 6.2
    feeder = data/helloworld.csv
    parts = [
      login
    ]
    skip-if = ["label-A", "label-C"]
  }

  hello-world-3 = {
    description = "Hello world journey 3"
    load = 0.1
    feeder = data/helloworld.csv
    parts = [
      home
    ]
    run-if = ["label-B"]
  }

  base-journey = {
    abstract = true
    description = "Base journey"
    feeder = data/helloworld.csv
    parts = [
      login,
      home
    ]
  }

}


# Default behaviour is to run all journeys. If that is not what you need you can specify the list of journeys to run
#journeysToRun = [
#   hello-world-1
#]

# You can specify the same list of journeys via environment variables:
#journeysToRun.0 = hello-world-1
