    *
    * https://gatling.io/docs/3.4/http/http_protocol/
    *
    * Configurations to note:
    *
    * `True-Client-IP`: Set to `java.util.Random()` value injected in the Gatling session during JourneySetup.journeys.
    * This value can be used to trace requests injected through the performance-test-runner library.
    *
    * `disableFollowRedirect`: Disables Gatling from following redirect automatically.This means the users of the
    * library should make explicit redirect requests.
    * https://gatling.io/docs/3.4/http/http_protocol/#response-handling-parameters
    *
    * Users of the library can override this default configuration by overriding `val httpProtocol` when extending
    * `PerformanceTestRunner` trait.
